## About
**mainline** is a tool for Arch Linux users to easily browse, install, and manage kernel versions from the official Arch Linux Archive. This is a fork of the original mainline tool, now modernized with **GTK4** and **Libadwaita**.

Sort by the Lock column to collect all the locked kernels together

## About
mainline is a fork of [ukuu](https://github.com/teejee2008/ukuu)  

## Changes
* Changed name from "ukuu" to "mainline"
* Removed all GRUB / bootloader options
* Removed all donate buttons, links, dialogs
* Removed all unused & unrelated code
* Removed all TeeJee lib code
* Better cache management
* Rewrote all exec() commands not to use temp files, temp bash scripts, and temp directories
* Rewrote the desktop notification scripts to be more reliable
* Reduced dependencies
* Per-kernel user notes
* Pinning/locking kernels
* Support for Arch Linux Archive and pacman integration
* Customizable external commands for the terminal window and for root access

## Features
* Download the list of available kernels from the [Arch Linux Archive](https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/l/linux/)
* Display, install, and uninstall kernels conveniently via GUI and CLI
* Modern UI built with **GTK4** and **Libadwaita**
* Optionally monitor and send desktop notifications when new kernels become available
* Kernels are installed using `pacman -U` for full system integration

## Build & Install
To build and install on Arch Linux:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo pacman -S base-devel vala meson ninja libgee json-glib vte3-gtk4 libadwaita aria2

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/johnppetersa/mainline.git
cd mainline
meson setup build --prefix=/usr
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

# Usage
Look for System -> Mainline Kernels in your desktop's Applications/Start menu.

Otherwise:  
CLI
```
$ mainline --help
$ mainline
```
GUI
```
$ mainline-gtk
```
Note that neither of those commands invoked sudo or pkexec or other su-alike.  
The app runs as the user and uses pkexec internally just for the pacman command.

## Buttons
**\[ Install \]** - downloads and installs the selected kernel

**\[ Uninstall \]** - uninstalls the selected kernel(1)

**\[ Repo \]** - launches your default https:// handler to the web page for the selected kernel  
If no kernels are selected (when first launching the app before clicking on any) launches the main page listing all the kernels.  
Use this to see the build summary and file list.

**\[ Uninstall Old \]** - uninstalls all installed kernels below the latest installed version(1)

**\[ Reload \]** - deletes, re-downloads, and re-reads the local cached copies of the index from the Arch Archive, and regenerates the displayed list.  

**\[ Settings \]** - access the [settings](settings.md) dialog to configure various options

**\[ About \]** - basic info and credits

**\[ Exit \]** - order pizza

(1) The currently running kernel and any locked kernels are protected and ignored.

## Pinning / Locking
The Lock checkboxes serve as both whitelist and blacklist.

A locked kernel will be frozen in whatever state it was in when you locked it.  
If it was installed, it will now stay installed.  
If it was not installed, it will now stay uninstalled.

All forms of install/uninstall commands & methods are affected.  
The gui "Install" and "Uninstall" buttons are inactive on that kernel.  
The cli "--install" and "--uninstall" commands ignore that kernel.  
The gui "Uninstall Old" button and the cli "--uninstall-old" command ignore that kernel.  
The cli "--install-latest" and "--notify" for the background notification ignore that kernel.  
The kernel is still visible, you can still write notes and pull up the PPA info page and toggle the lock to unlock it.

This can be handy to keep a stock distribution kernel from being uninstalled by "Uninstall Old", or prevent a known buggy kernel from being installed by "--install-latest" and prevent "--notify" from generating a notification to install it.

## Notes
Clicking on the Notes field allows to attach arbitrary note text to a kernel.

## Display Sorting
All column headers are clickable to re-sort the list.  
The "Kernel" coulumn sorts by the special kernel version number sort where "1.2.3-rc3" is higher than "1.2.3-rc2", yet "1.2.3" is higher than "1.2.3-rc3".  
Sorting on the "Lock" column is a way to see all locked kernels together.  
Sorting on the "Status" column is a way to see all installed kernels together.  
Sorting on the "Notes" column is a way to see all kernels that have any notes together.  

# Help / FAQ

## [MainlineBuilds WIKI](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds)

## General debugging  
  The `-v` or `-v #` option, or the environment variable `VERBOSE=#`, enables increasing levels of verbosity.  
  Example: `$ mainline-gtk -v 3` or `$ VERBOSE=3 mainline-gtk`  
  The -v option may also be used alone or repeated. The default with no `-v` is the same as `-v 1`.  
  Each additional `-v` is like adding 1. ie: `-v -v -v` is like `-v 4` or `VERBOSE=4`  
  0 = silence all output  
  1 = normal output (default)  
  2 = same as --debug  
  3 = more verbose  
  4 = even more  
  5+ mostly just for uncommenting things in the code and recompiling, not really useful in the release builds
  
  A few lines of output are printed before the commandline has been parsed, so `-v 0` doesn't silence them.  
  The environment variable is read earlier in the process and can silence all output.  
  `VERBOSE=0 mainline install-latest --yes`

  The exit value is also meaningful.  
  `VERBOSE=0 ;mainline install-latest --yes && mainline uninstall-old --yes`  

## If **Uninstall Old** doesn't remove some distribution kernel packages  
  Use your normal package manager like apt or synaptic to remove the parent meta-package:  
  `$ sudo apt remove linux-image-generic`  
  Then **Uninstall Old** should successfully remove everything.  

## Secure Boot  
  If you want to have secure boot, then you need to have a signed kernel, and the mainline kernels are not signed.

  This might be an answer.  
  I did not write this, have not tried to use it, nor even looked at it's code to see if it should be trusted.  
  It appears to be a script that you install in /etc that will be automatically triggered by dpkg as a post-install step.  
  (I think you also have to read the rest of the readme to set up a shim and owner-key etc, this script would just be the last step to integrate with dpkg after you got everything else actually working.)

## Kernels with broken dependencies  
  The build environment that builds the kernels is newer than most installed systems, and so the built kernels occasionally but regularly break compatibility with all current release and older systems.

  The only convenient, practical, clean, safe resolution is "Update your system to the level that includes those dependencies naturally.".  
  And don't install any newer kernels until that is possible. And if that means the next version of Ubuntu isn't even due to be released for another 6 months, so be it.

  Otherwise, here are some hack options you may amuse yourself with (substitute "libssl3" for whatever is actually broken for you today): [Install libssl3](../../wiki/Install-libssl3)  
  TLDR: monkey with apt configs to add beta repos and use priority settings and pinning to try to only let certain packages auto update from them, or manually download specific .deb files from the beta repos and install them with dpkg.

## Missing kernels  
  Only viable installable kernels are shown by default. Failed or incomplete builds for your platform/arch are not shown unless the "Hide Invalid" setting is un-selected.  
  If you think the list is missing a kernel, press the "PPA" button to jump to the mainline-ppa web site where the .deb packages come from, and look at the build results for the missing kernel, and you will usually find that it is a failed or incomplete build for your arch (ex: amd64), and can not be installed.

# TODO & WIP
* Replace Process.spawn_async_with_pipes("aria2c ...",...) with libcurl  
* Make the background process for notifications detect when the user logs out of the desktop session and exit itself  
* Move the notification/dbus code from the current shell script into the app and make an "applet" mode  
* Combine the gtk and cli apps into one, or, make the gtk app into a pure front-end for the cli app, either way  
* Replace the commandline parser  
* Toggles to show/hide the rc or invalid kernels in the main ui instead of going to settings  
* Right-click menu for more functions for a given kernel, such as reloading the cache just for a single kernel to check for new build status etc, without adding 18 buttons all over the ui.  
* Properly handle when a kernel has multiple builds like 5.16

# hints  
* cron job to always have the latest kernel installed.  
  If you install this, you should disable the notifications in settings.
```
$ sudo -i
# cat >/etc/cron.d/mainline <<-%EOF
	# Check for new kernels on kernel.ubuntu.com every 4 hours, randomize over ~2.8 hours
	1 */4 * * * root sleep ${RANDOM:0:4} ;VERBOSE=0 ;mainline --install-latest --yes && { mainline --uninstall-old --yes ;for a in /home/*/.Xauthority ;do echo [[ -s $a ]] && DISPLAY=:0.0 XAUTHORITY=$a notify-send -t 0 -a mainline -i mainline "Mainline Kernels" "New kernel installed" ;done ; }
%EOF
```
